A HTML code generator that creates a photo gallery with some customizations. 

I created this simple solution to a need that my father was having on some of the sites he has.

* **Root:** pass the path of the images that you want to upload.
* **Width:** width of each image in pixels.
* **Height:** height of each image in pixel.
* **Border color:** select a color for the border of the images by placing the mouse over them.
* **Amount per line:** number of images per line.

**_After passing the parameters you must upload the images you need._**
